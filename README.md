# webpCreate
Get your images converted for fast load times! webpCreate scans a directory for JPG, JPEG, and PNG files, then converts them to web-ready WEBP images. Further, it organizes the files to keep your directories clean. 

webpCreate is a Zsh script for batch-converting `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and `.png` files into `.webp` format with optional overwrite/increment/skip behavior. It organizes originals and `.webp` output into subfolders and reports file size savings.

I use it straight from my MacOS terminal window. First, I use "cd" to get to the directory with my images (often a big dump of images from a client, or a photoshop batcnh export). Then I type "webpCreate" and watch the magic happen.
